                <h3>Among the top benefits in working with schools for charities is to be able to support vulnerable young people’s mental health needs on site, which is where they spend much of their time during the week and often feel most comfortable.

Latest figures show the urgent need for charities to help.
one in six children in Egypt had a probable mental disorder during 2021. This is up on 2017’s rate of one in nine.
So we decided to help these students and we were able to help 10,000 students
