                <h3>LIVESTOCK  HEAD  DISTRIBUTION <br><br>

                    This is one of the most successful projects given the significance of livestock and the animal wealth in the Egyptian countryside and how it contributes to its economy.  It provides milk and meat for human consumption. Farmers depend on livestock to transport products. Cattle farming is important to increase the overall income of farmers and raise their standard of living. <br><br>
