                <h3>The use of "solar energy" saves electricity consumption, as it is a safe source of sustainable and renewable energy, and protects the environment from greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>

                    The solar power plant has a capacity of 450 kilowatts, in addition to its effective role in saving about 502 tons of gas emissions annually.<br><br>
                    
                    The work of solar power pants is divided into two phases:<br><br>
                    
                    The first phase:<br><br>
