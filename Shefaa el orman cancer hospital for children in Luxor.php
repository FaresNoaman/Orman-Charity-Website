                <h3>In continuation of the previous successes in this field, a new cancer hospital for children was founded/ built given the increase in the number of cancer cases of children in Upper Egypt. <br><br>
                    The need was high and the availability of proper treatment was insufficient; let alone the agony of patients seeking treatment—a journey which approximately takes 14 hours from Upper Egypt to Cairo.<br><br>
                     Added to this is the search for accommodation for the child’s family during the  period of treatment.<br><br>
                      In order to fulfill such demands and to facilitate the process for the children and their families, it was necessary to establish a highly equipped specialized hospital in the area.<br><br>

                    The following certificates were granted for the outstanding work; Occupational safety and health, Environmental management, records and documentation.<br><br>

                    An internal path connecting Shefaa Al Orman  Adults Cancer Hospital was constructed to facilitate the mobility of the doctors and the nursing team while providing their 24-hour service to their patients. <br><br>
