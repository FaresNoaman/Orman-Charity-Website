                <h3>Losing a limb can lead to immobility and inability to manage daily activities such as going to school, work or staying independent. Once a prosthetic device is installed, the patient can resume his activity and become once more partially or totally independent. <br><br>

 

                    Al Orman  Organization  considers the prosthetic system to be a rehabilitation and development project for those with special needs like those who went through the process of amputation of  legs, feet or toes. It helps them retain their ability to work, regain their sense of independence and non-reliance on others and therefore lead a normal and practical life. This naturally helps raise their morale as well.<br><br> 
                    
                    The prices of prosthetic devices range from EGP 5,400 to EGP 22,500. Wheelchairs are offered to totally handicapped people. <br><br>
                    
                    Steps for getting a prosthetic device: <br><br>
                    
                    ●      After 6 months from time of injury, the patient will be called to come to Al Orman Association so the manufacturer or importer get the proper measurements of patient’s limb<br><br>
                    
                    ●      Once limb is ready, the patient gets to try the  device<br><br>
                    
                    ●      The prosthetic device is delivered  after 30 days <br><br>

                    ●      Hearing is important to maintain communication with others as well as participate and contribute to the community. Loss of hearing often leads to problems related to education and work opportunities and results in withdrawal and depression. Type of  hearing aid is decided by the audiologist  after setting the exact measurement of  the patient’s hearing level.<br> <br>
                    
                    ●      Medical hearing aid is offered every 4 years based on measurement of audiometer Device and is received at headquarters of  Al Orman  Organization <br><br>
