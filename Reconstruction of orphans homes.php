                <h3>Al Orman  pays great attention to orphans in poor villages and hamlets in Lower  and Upper Egypt.<br><br>
                     Al Orman  took the initiative to upgrade and improve orphansâ€™ homes by installing  clean water connections, finishing floors and walls and installing  roofs to protect the orphans from the summer heat and the  winter rain. Another form of support is through providing a small project for the orphan to transfer him from the circle of need to the circle of sufficiency.<br><br>

                    Join us, donate to  build an orphan's house by providing water with a share of EGP 250, or buy new clothes with a share of  EGP 250, or finish the walls and floors of his house with a share of EGP 300, or build a roof  for his house with a share of EGP 500.. Or a small project with a share of EGP 450.</h3>
